Projects I developed while in an advanced java class at college.

Dice Java Program
  This program lets you roll a 6, 24, and 54 sided dice and get a random number within the dice's size.
  
Coffee Maker Emulation
  This program emualates a coffee pot heating water and producing coffee. The emulator runs in a terminal while the values update the UI
    You can compile this program with "javac *.java" and run it with "java CoffeeMakerApplication".
    
Sweeper Bot - Unfinished*
  This program is an adaption of the Coffee Maker Emulation and is meant to replicate the sweeper bot automatic vacuum cleaner.
